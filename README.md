# Documentation
Pok√©dex application, containing the data of all pok√©mons, the app makes data requests to the Pok√©API and saves them locally so that the user can have offline access to the data.

# Features
* All official pok√©dex entries
* Search by name
* Pok√©mon details
* Offline persistence

# Flow

* ## Splash
On this screen, the logo with a button is displayed. When clicking on the button, a check is made to see if the data is already persisted, if there is no saved data, a request is initiated to obtain the data of all pok√©mons and save them locally.

If there is saved data, or it was possible to obtain and save data from the API, the user is redirected to the Home screen.

* ## Home
In this screen, the saved data of the pok√©mons will be loaded in a list, by default, the list will be ordered by the pok√©dex number. The list is composed of cards, with the colors of the pok√©mon, its name, photo and type, when clicking on the card the user will be directed to the details screen of that pok√©mon.

Just above the screen, the user can search for a pok√©mon by its name.

You can filter the list by Pok√©dex number, alphabetically or sort order.

Also on this screen is a button that will open the details screen for a random pokemon

* ## Details
This screen displays the pok√©mon's details, with data such as its name, photo, types, weight, height, possible abilities, pok√©dex description and its base status. The screen will adapt to the color of the Pok√©mon's primary type.

In the upper left corner, there is a button to go back to home.

In the right and left corners, it is possible to navigate between the pok√©mons, the left button will take to the predecessor pok√©mon by the pok√©dex number, the right button will lead to the successor pok√©mon by the pok√©dex number. If you are on the first pok√©mon on the list, the left button will not appear, if you are on the last pok√©mon on the list, the right button will not appear.

# Architecture
The project architecture is divided into layers, following the MVVM pattern, with UI, Domain and Data layers. [More architecture details](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide)

![](https://github.com/gladson-sza/pokedex-egsys/blob/master/documents/layer_diagram.png) 

## UI Layer
The UI Layer is responsible for handling data presentation and user interaction.

## Domain Layer
The domain layer is the intermediary layer between the interface and data layer, which is responsible for performing the data call, dealing with business logic and then notifying the interface layer. Works as a controller.

## Data Layer
The data layer is responsible for both making API calls and persisting in the local database, in addition to containing business logic.
